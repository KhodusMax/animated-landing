                    <p>Under the UK-UA: Reform Assistance programme funded by UKAID, the PwC in Ukraine team supported the ProZorro team within the MEDT to implement a Human Resources Management (HRM) model based on the High Performing Organisation (HPO) concept of HRM, which is based on line managers rather than a dedicated HR team.</p>
                    <p>With project support, the ProZorro team defined annual personal goals and KPIs as well as annual strategic KPIs for the organisation aligned with the long-term strategic goals of the organisation. It was the first time such project was implemented in the first time this was done in the public sector in Ukraine.</p>
