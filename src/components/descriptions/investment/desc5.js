                    <p>The PwC in Ukraine team helped to maintain the dialog between the authorities and business representatives providing valuable insight on the tax regulations in other countries exporting iron ore: Australia, China, India, South Africa, Russia, Kazakhstan, Brazil, and Canada.</p>
                    <p>In tight cooperation with PwCâ€™s experts from each of these countries, we collected lots of information about tax regimes, analysed the tax burden for the companies producing iron ore and showed the impact of the possible rate increase on the Ukrainian companies and the competitive position of Ukraine on the world iron ore market.</p>
